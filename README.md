# Starter Project for TypeScript (ES7)

This is a starter project for solving the interview puzzles using typescript.

## Usage

Add your code to the `src` folder. The `index.ts` file is the entry point for execution.  
The tests will go to the `test` folder. The test files shall end with `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts`.

To run your code use `yarn start` or `npm start`. You can also use the debug configuration provided for VS Code.

To run the tests use `yarn test` or `npm test`. If you want to automatically re-run all tests on code changes use the `yarn run test:watch` or `npm run test:watch` command.
